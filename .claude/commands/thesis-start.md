# TezAtlas — Academic Thesis Writing Assistant

This is an academic thesis writing project. Follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. Find and read `skills/INDEX.md` — this is your skill graph map.
2. Read `skills/core/iron-rules.md` — 5 rules that apply in every session.
3. Check the current project state:
   - Does `proje_kimlik.md` exist? → If YES, this is an existing project. Continue from where you left off.
   - If NO → Start from Phase 0: read `skills/phases/phase-0-identity.md`.

## Continuing an Existing Project

Apply the `skills/core/context-management.md` system:
1. Read `DURUM_OZETI.md` → find out where you left off
2. Read `MEMORY.md` → check progress
3. Read `DERSLER.md` → review learned rules
4. Read `TERMINOLOJI.md` → terminology consistency
5. Read relevant `_notlar.md` files → source notes
6. Ask the user: "Which section shall we work on?"

## Starting a New Project

Read `skills/phases/phase-0-identity.md` and ask Phase 0 questions. Then:
- `skills/moc/MOC-universities.md` → load university template
- `skills/moc/MOC-disciplines.md` → load discipline module
- `skills/moc/MOC-citations.md` → load citation guide
- Read `skills/phases/phase-1-topic.md` → proceed to Phase 1

## Iron Rules (Always Apply)

1. **No writing without sources.** If no source in /kaynaklar/, don't write — wait.
2. **Snowball sampling is mandatory.** Scan every source's references for new sources.
3. **AI downloads first.** Try Anna's Archive or open access. If it can't, ask the user.
4. **Fabricated citations = academic misconduct.** Only cite from PDFs in /kaynaklar/.
5. **Advisor checkpoints cannot be skipped.** Ask about advisor approval at every critical phase.

## Skill Graph Navigation

All details are in the `skills/` skill graph:
- **Phases:** `skills/moc/MOC-phases.md` → `skills/phases/phase-X-*.md`
- **Techniques:** `skills/techniques/` (snowball sampling, saturation check, PDF reading, etc.)
- **Disciplines:** `skills/moc/MOC-disciplines.md` → `templates/disciplines/`
- **Citations:** `skills/moc/MOC-citations.md` → `templates/citations/`
- **Tooling:** `skills/tooling/` (anna's archive, git workflow)
